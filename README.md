# chromatic-tuner
A chromatic tuner built in javascript using freelizer, which implements a noise gate and noise cancellation

Freelizer already came with the ability to identify notes, but to keep it challenging I removed all parts of freelizer that did not solely identify the frequency of mic audio. I also added a few lines to determine volume levels which let me make the noise gate.
